	and to think critically. Intelligence plus character - that is the goal of true education."</i> <strong>-Martin Luther King</strong><br><br>
Parents often get confused when it comes to provide quality education to their kids.This creates a dilemma 
	where to go, enquire and compare among a number of schools available .It becomes a very tedious procedure and sometimes results in the
	wrong judgement and selection of school for the kid risking his/her future.
	<br><br>This website serves the purpose mentioned above.This website is contributing to ensure transparency of school and its administration.
	On the basis of various parameters like fee structure, infrastructure, faculty, and other facilities one can select a school that is most
suited to him/her.<br><br><br>Happy Schooling...:)</p>
